# Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for UI components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Finding and Using Components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` directory, following the aliases configured in `components.json`

## Using Components

Import components from the ui directory using the configured aliases:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example usage:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Installing Additional Components

Many more components are available but not currently installed. You can view the complete list at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

To install additional components, use the Shadcn CLI:


```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the Accordion component:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Note: `npx shadcn-ui@latest` is deprecated, use `npx shadcn@latest` instead
